## Prioritization Rationale

### Risk-Based Prioritization

1. **Infrastructure First (Sprint 6)**
   - Timeout and state management are foundational
   - Affect all other operations
   - Required for reliable testing
   - Highest impact on system stability

2. **Security Second (Sprint 7)**
   - Critical for production deployment
   - Independent implementation possible
   - Clear scope and requirements
   - Regulatory/compliance considerations

3. **Testing Last (Sprint 8)**
   - Requires stable infrastructure
   - Benefits from completed improvements
   - Validates all previous work
   - Comprehensive coverage needs time

## Conclusion

The four remaining code quality issues represent important but non-blocking improvements that will significantly enhance the production readiness of Belay.NET. By integrating them into the existing v0.2.0 milestone structure across Sprints 6-8, we can address these issues systematically while maintaining project momentum.

The prioritization ensures foundational reliability improvements come first, followed by security hardening, and culminating in comprehensive validation. This approach minimizes risk while maximizing the value delivered in each sprint.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve sprint allocation with team
2. Assign developers to each issue
3. Begin Sprint 6 planning session
4. Update project board with new issues
5. Communicate timeline to stakeholders
