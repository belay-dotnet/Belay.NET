## Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factor
The most critical aspect of this milestone is ensuring that the **executor framework (Issue 002-101)** is implemented correctly, as all other components depend on it. This should be the first priority and should be completed before other components are built on top of it.

### Integration Strategy
Components should be developed with clear interface contracts and mock implementations to allow parallel development. Regular integration checkpoints should validate that components work together as expected.

### Performance Focus
Each component should be implemented with performance in mind from the beginning. Performance regression tests should be added as components are completed to prevent performance issues from accumulating.
