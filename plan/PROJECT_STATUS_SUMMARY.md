# Belay.NET Project Status Summary

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Project Phase**: Post-Simplification - Raw REPL Protocol Fix Required  
**Current Priority**: CRITICAL - Fix Raw REPL Protocol (Issue 001-012)

## Executive Summary

The Belay.NET project has undergone aggressive architectural simplification achieving 50-97% code reduction across major subsystems. While the simplification is complete and builds successfully, the raw REPL protocol implementation is not functioning correctly, blocking all hardware integration testing.

### Recent Changes (Commit 349a370)
- **Architectural Simplification**: 50-97% code reduction achieved
- **Lines Eliminated**: ~5,000+ replaced with ~600 focused lines
- **Executor Hierarchy**: Eliminated complex inheritance (50-60% reduction)
- **Communication Layer**: Simplified to single DeviceConnection class (85% reduction)
- **Exception Handling**: Flattened to single exception type (97% reduction)

### Critical Issue
- **Raw REPL Protocol Broken**: Hardware shows REPL prompt instead of executing code
- **Root Cause**: No prompt verification, incorrect parsing, missing timeout handling
- **Impact**: Blocks all hardware testing and core functionality

## Milestone Progress

### ✅ Milestone v0.1.0: Foundation Release (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: All primary objectives achieved
- **Test Results**: 35/35 unit tests passing
- **Architecture**: Core communication foundation established
- **API**: Clean, strongly-typed interface complete
- **Infrastructure**: Logging, error handling, and resource management

### ⏳ Milestone v0.1.1: Hardware Validation Release (READY TO START)
- **Duration**: 2 weeks estimated
- **Requirements**: MicroPython hardware (Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32)
- **Objectives**: Validate implementation against real hardware
- **Success Criteria**: >95% reliability, performance targets met

## API Surface Overview

### Device Management
```csharp
// Factory pattern device creation
using var device = Device.FromConnectionString("serial:COM3");
using var device = Device.FromConnectionString("subprocess:micropython");

// Device discovery
var devices = await Device.DiscoverDevicesAsync();
using var device = await Device.DiscoverFirstAsync();
```

### Code Execution
```csharp
// Basic execution
string result = await device.ExecuteAsync("print('Hello World')");

// Typed execution
int value = await device.ExecuteAsync<int>("2 + 2");

// Complex code
string code = @"
import sys
print(f'Python {sys.version}')
";
await device.ExecuteAsync(code);
```

### Connection Management
```csharp
// Lifecycle management
await device.ConnectAsync();
await device.ExecuteAsync("print('Connected!')");
await device.DisconnectAsync();

// Event handling
device.OutputReceived += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Device: {e.Output}");
device.StateChanged += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"State: {e.NewState}");
```

### File Operations
```csharp
// File transfer
await device.PutFileAsync("local_file.py", "/device/file.py");
byte[] content = await device.GetFileAsync("/device/data.txt");
```
