# Epic 001: Device Communication Foundation

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Hardware Validation  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 weeks (COMPLETED)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Completion Date**: August 7, 2025

## Summary

Establish the foundational device communication layer for Belay.NET, implementing raw REPL protocol support and core device management functionality. This epic provides the essential infrastructure upon which all other features depend.

## Business Value

- Enables basic device connectivity and code execution
- Establishes reliable communication protocols
- Provides foundation for testing without physical hardware
- Creates extensible architecture for future communication methods

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Successfully connect to MicroPython devices via serial/USB
- ✅ Execute Python code on remote devices with reliable results
- ✅ Support subprocess communication with MicroPython unix port for testing
- ✅ Implement proper error handling and device state management  
- ⏳ Achieve >95% reliability for basic code execution operations (Requires hardware validation)
- ✅ Complete unit test coverage for all communication protocols (35/35 tests passing)

## Technical Scope

### In Scope
- Raw REPL protocol implementation (both raw mode and raw-paste mode)
- Serial/USB device communication
- Subprocess communication for testing
- Basic device detection and connection management
- Error handling and exception mapping
- Connection state management and recovery
- Basic code execution with return value parsing

### Out of Scope  
- WebREPL wireless communication (covered in Epic 002)
- File synchronization (covered in Epic 003)
- Advanced device features (threading, generators, etc.)
- Package management functionality
- CLI tools and user interfaces

## Architecture Impact

### New Components
- `Belay.Core` assembly with core communication abstractions
- `IDeviceCommunication` interface for protocol abstraction
- `SerialDeviceCommunication` for USB/serial connections  
- `SubprocessDeviceCommunication` for testing infrastructure
- `Device` base class for high-level device management
- Raw REPL protocol implementation with state management

### Key Interfaces
```csharp
public interface IDeviceCommunication : IDisposable
{
    Task<string> ExecuteAsync(string code, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<T> ExecuteAsync<T>(string code, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    event EventHandler<DeviceOutputEventArgs> OutputReceived;
    event EventHandler<DeviceStateChangeEventArgs> StateChanged;
}
```

## Breaking Down into Issues

### Foundation Issues
- **Issue 001-001**: Raw REPL Protocol Implementation
- **Issue 001-002**: Serial Device Communication Layer  
- **Issue 001-003**: Subprocess Communication for Testing
- **Issue 001-004**: Device Factory and Connection String Parsing
- **Issue 001-005**: Error Handling and Exception Hierarchy

### Integration Issues  
- **Issue 001-006**: Device Class Implementation
- **Issue 001-007**: Response Parsing and Type Conversion
- **Issue 001-008**: Connection State Management
- **Issue 001-009**: MicroPython Unix Port Integration

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Raw REPL Protocol Complexity**: The raw-paste mode protocol is intricate with flow control
  - *Mitigation*: Reference original Python implementation, create comprehensive tests
- **Cross-Platform Serial Communication**: Different behavior on Windows/Linux/macOS
  - *Mitigation*: Test on all platforms, abstract platform differences
- **Device State Synchronization**: Managing connection state across reconnections
  - *Mitigation*: Design state machine, implement connection recovery

### Medium Risk Items  
- **Performance of Subprocess Communication**: May be slower than expected
  - *Mitigation*: Profile early, optimize if needed
- **Error Message Mapping**: Complex traceback parsing from device
  - *Mitigation*: Start with basic mapping, enhance incrementally

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Mock-based testing for all communication protocols
- State machine validation for raw REPL protocol
- Error condition handling and recovery scenarios
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Integration Testing
- Physical device testing with Raspberry Pi Pico
