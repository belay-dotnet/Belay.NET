## API Surface (v0.1.0)

### Core Device API
```csharp
// Device connection and management
var device = new Device("serial:COM3");
await device.ConnectAsync();

// Basic code execution
var result = await device.ExecuteAsync("2 + 2");
var typedResult = await device.ExecuteAsync<int>("len([1, 2, 3])");

// Device information
Console.WriteLine($"Connected to {device.Implementation} {device.Version}");

// Cleanup
await device.DisconnectAsync();
device.Dispose();
```

### Factory Pattern Support
```csharp
// Connection string-based creation
var device1 = DeviceFactory.Create("serial:COM3:115200");
var device2 = DeviceFactory.Create("subprocess:micropython");

// Device discovery
var availableDevices = await SerialDeviceDiscovery.DiscoverMicroPythonDevicesAsync();
var device3 = DeviceFactory.Create(availableDevices.First().ConnectionString);
```

### Event-Driven Communication
```csharp
device.OutputReceived += (sender, args) => Console.WriteLine($"Device: {args.Output}");
device.StateChanged += (sender, args) => Console.WriteLine($"State: {args.NewState}");
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Target: >90% Coverage)
