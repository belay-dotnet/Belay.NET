## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

#### 1. CI Breakage
**Risk:** New workflows fail in production  
**Mitigation:** 
- Run parallel with old workflows first
- Extensive testing in feature branch
- Gradual rollout

#### 2. Performance Regression
**Risk:** Containers slower than expected  
**Mitigation:**
- Continuous benchmarking
- Optimization phase built-in
- Rollback plan ready

#### 3. Team Resistance
**Risk:** Developers uncomfortable with containers  
**Mitigation:**
- Early involvement and feedback
- Comprehensive training
- Clear documentation

### Contingency Plans

#### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Quick rollback
git revert <merge-commit>
git push origin main

# Restore old workflows
git checkout main~1 -- .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Restore old CI workflows"
git push
```

#### Partial Implementation
If full containerization proves problematic:
1. Keep containers for documentation only
2. Use hybrid approach (containers + traditional)
3. Phase implementation over longer period

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Lead Developer**: Full-time for 3 weeks
- **DevOps Support**: 50% time for Week 2
- **Team Testing**: 2-4 hours per developer
- **Documentation**: 20% time throughout

### Infrastructure
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Free for public images
- **GitHub Actions**: Within free tier limits
- **Local Development**: Docker Desktop required

### Budget
- **Direct Costs**: $0 (using free tiers)
- **Opportunity Cost**: 120 developer hours
- **Expected Savings**: $150-200/month ongoing

## Communication Plan

### Week 1
- Daily standup updates
- End-of-week demo to team

### Week 2
- Mid-week progress report
- Security review meeting
- Performance benchmarking session

### Week 3
- Stakeholder presentation
- Go-live decision meeting
- Retrospective and celebration

## Tracking and Monitoring

### Daily Metrics
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily tracking script

echo "Containers built: $(docker images | grep belay | wc -l)"
echo "CI time: $(gh run list --limit 1 --json conclusion,durationMS | jq '.[0].durationMS / 60000')"
echo "Image sizes:"
docker images | grep belay
```
