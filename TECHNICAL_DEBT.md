# Technical Debt - Task Attribute Implementation

This document tracks critical technical debt identified during the Task attribute MVP implementation that must be addressed before production release.

## Critical Issues (Block Production)

### CRITICAL-1: Stack Frame Reflection Security Vulnerability
**Location**: `BaseExecutor.GetCallingMethod()` and `Device.GetCallingMethod()`
**Impact**: Security risk, performance overhead, unreliable in optimized builds
**Description**: Using stack trace inspection for method detection is fragile and poses security risks
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix immediately
**Assigned**: Next sprint
**Fix**: Replace with explicit method registration or attribute-based routing through method interception proxies

### CRITICAL-2: Race Condition in Exclusive Execution  
**Location**: `TaskExecutor.ExecuteExclusiveAsync()`
**Impact**: Data corruption, inconsistent device state
**Description**: Exclusive semaphore doesn't prevent non-exclusive methods from executing concurrently
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix before any exclusive operations
**Assigned**: Next sprint  
**Fix**: Implement reader-writer lock pattern where exclusive methods acquire write lock

### CRITICAL-3: Missing Transaction Boundaries
**Location**: `TaskExecutor.ApplyPoliciesAndExecuteAsync()`
**Impact**: Inconsistent state on partial failures
**Description**: No transactional guarantees around device operations and caching
**Priority**: P0 - Must fix for reliability
**Assigned**: Next sprint
**Fix**: Implement proper transaction semantics or compensating actions

## Major Issues (Fix Next Release)

### MAJOR-1: Ineffective Python Code Generation Strategy
**Location**: `BaseExecutor.GeneratePythonMethodCall()`
**Impact**: Circular dependency, confusion about execution model
**Description**: Methods calling `device.ExecuteAsync()` internally creates circular dependency
**Priority**: P1 - Architectural clarity needed
**Fix**: Clarify execution model - either methods generate Python code OR execute it, not both

### MAJOR-2: Incomplete Error Handling in Protocol Layer
**Location**: `AdaptiveRawReplProtocol.ExecuteCodeAsync()`
**Impact**: Failed device operations, protocol desynchronization
**Description**: No handling for partial failures or protocol corruption
**Priority**: P1 - Essential for reliability
**Fix**: Implement robust error recovery with protocol reset capabilities

### MAJOR-3: Type Safety Issues in Result Conversion
**Location**: `BaseExecutor.ConvertResult<T>()`  
**Impact**: Runtime failures for complex types
**Description**: Simplistic type conversion fails for collections and custom objects
**Priority**: P1 - Required for real-world usage
**Fix**: Implement proper deserialization with JSON or custom converters

## Current Status

**MVP Implementation**: ✅ Working for basic scenarios with documented limitations
**Production Readiness**: ❌ Critical issues must be resolved first
**Test Coverage**: ⚠️ Infrastructure tests pass, integration tests need protocol fixes

## Mitigation Strategy

1. **Document limitations clearly** in all user-facing documentation
2. **Add runtime validation** to detect unsupported scenarios early  
3. **Implement feature flags** to disable problematic features in production
4. **Create comprehensive test suite** covering edge cases and error conditions

## Next Sprint Priorities

1. Fix CRITICAL-1: Replace stack-based method detection
2. Fix CRITICAL-2: Implement proper reader-writer locking  
3. Fix CRITICAL-3: Add transaction boundaries
4. Fix MAJOR-1: Clarify Python code generation strategy

## Long-term Architectural Improvements

- Implement method deployment infrastructure for true code deployment
- Add distributed tracing and telemetry support
- Complete adaptive protocol with full capability detection
- Add performance benchmarks and optimization
