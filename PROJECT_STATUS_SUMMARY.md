## API Surface Overview

### Device Management
```csharp
// Factory pattern device creation
using var device = Device.FromConnectionString("serial:COM3");
using var device = Device.FromConnectionString("subprocess:micropython");

// Device discovery
var devices = await Device.DiscoverDevicesAsync();
using var device = await Device.DiscoverFirstAsync();
```

### Code Execution
```csharp
// Basic execution
string result = await device.ExecuteAsync("print('Hello World')");

// Typed execution
int value = await device.ExecuteAsync<int>("2 + 2");

// Complex code
string code = @"
import sys
print(f'Python {sys.version}')
";
await device.ExecuteAsync(code);
```

### Connection Management
```csharp
// Lifecycle management
await device.ConnectAsync();
await device.ExecuteAsync("print('Connected!')");
await device.DisconnectAsync();

// Event handling
device.OutputReceived += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Device: {e.Output}");
device.StateChanged += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"State: {e.NewState}");
```

### File Operations
```csharp
// File transfer
await device.PutFileAsync("local_file.py", "/device/file.py");
byte[] content = await device.GetFileAsync("/device/data.txt");
```
